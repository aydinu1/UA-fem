# UA-fem
2D FE solver for quasi-static electromagnetics problems. 
Currently non-linear problems with voltage source can be handled with first order finite elements.
The mesh of the problem geometry has to be supplied externally using e.g. [gmsh](https://gmsh.info/).

There is an example transformer model in the directory which can be tested by running "run_Transformer.py". The mesh for this example has been generated by gmsh.
