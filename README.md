# UA-fem
2D FE solver for quasi-static electromagnetics problems. 
Currently non-linear problems with voltage source can be handled with first order finite elements.
The mesh of the problem geometry has to be supplied externally.

There is an example transformer model in the directory which can be tested by running "run_Transformer.py".
